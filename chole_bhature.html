        <li>Drain and rinse the soaked chickpeas. In a pressure cooker, add the chickpeas and enough water to cover them. Cook until the chickpeas are tender (about 4-5 whistles on medium heat). Alternatively, you can cook them in a pot until tender.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions, garlic, ginger, and green chilies. Saut√© until the onions become golden brown.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and the oil starts to separate.</li>
        <li>Add turmeric powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, red chili powder, and salt. Mix well and cook for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the cooked chickpeas and mix them well with the spice mixture. Add water (around 1 to 1.5 cups) to achieve the desired consistency of the gravy.</li>
        <li>Simmer the chole on low heat for 15-20 minutes, allowing the flavors to blend. Adjust seasoning if needed.</li>
        <li>Finally, add garam masala and amchur, mix well, and turn off the heat. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.</li>

        <li>Mix the ingredients well, and then add water gradually to form a smooth and soft dough. Knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until it's elastic.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>After resting, divide the dough into small balls, and roll each ball into a flat disc of about 4-5 inches in diameter.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium-high heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully slide in the rolled bhature and fry until they puff up and become golden brown on both sides. Ensure they cook evenly.</li>
