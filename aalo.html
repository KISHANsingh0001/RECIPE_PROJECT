    <p><h1>Instructions To prepare aalo paratha</h1></p>
    <ol>
        <li> <p><h3>Making the dough:</h3></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, add the whole 
                    wheat flour and salt. Mix well.</li>
                <li>Slowly add water and knead the 
                    dough until it becomes smooth and elastic.
                     Add a little oil and knead again to coat the 
                     dough with oil. Cover it with a damp cloth and
                     let it rest for about 15-20 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            
        </li>
        <li><p><h3>Preparing the potato filling:</h3></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Boil the potatoes until they are fully cooked. You can either boil them in a pressure cooker or on the stovetop. Once boiled, peel the skin and mash them well 
                    using a potato masher or fork. Ensure there are 
                    no lumps.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, add the mashed potatoes, finely chopped onions (if using), green chilies, cumin seeds, garam masala, turmeric powder, red chili powder, chopped cilantro, and salt. Mix everything thoroughly until
                     the spices are well incorporated with the potatoes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p><h3>Assembling and rolling the parathas:</h3></p>
           <ul>
            <li>Divide the dough into equal-sized balls
                 (approximately the size of a golf ball) 
                 and roll them into smooth balls.</li>
            <li>Take one dough ball and flatten 
                it slightly. Dust it with some dry
                 wheat flour and roll it out into a
                  small disc, about 4-5 inches
                   in diameter.</li>
            <li>Place a portion of the potato 
                filling (about 2-3 tablespoons) 
                in the center of the disc.</li>
            <li>Gather the edges of the disc towards
                 the center, covering the filling entirely, 
                 and pinch the dough to seal it properly.</li>
            <li>Flatten this stuffed ball with your palms
                 and dust it with some dry flour.</li>
            <li>Using a rolling pin, gently roll out the 
                stuffed ball into a circular paratha. Be
                 careful not to press too hard as it may
                  break, and the filling might come out.</li>
           </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p><h3>Cooking the Aloo Parathas:</h3></p>
           <ul>
            <li>Heat a tawa or flat skillet over medium heat. Once it's hot, place the rolled paratha on it.</li>
            <li>Cook one side until you see small bubbles forming on the surface. Then, flip the paratha and cook the other side.</li>
            <li>Apply some oil or ghee on the cooked side, spreading it evenly. Flip the paratha again and apply oil on the other side as well.</li>
            <li>Press the edges with a spatula to ensure even cooking and cook until both sides are golden brown and crispy.</li>
           </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p><h3>Serving Aloo Paratha:</h3></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Once the Aloo Paratha is cooked, remove it
                 from the tawa and place it on a plate.</li>
            <li>Serve the hot and delicious Aloo Paratha with 
                plain yogurt, pickle, chutney,
                 or even a dollop of butter on top.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
